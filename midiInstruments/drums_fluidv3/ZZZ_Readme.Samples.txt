Where did these samples come from:

I downloaded Frank Wen's (http://www.powermage.com/fluid) "FLUID R3" soundfont from:
http://soundfonts.homemusician.net/collections_soundfonts/fluid_release_3.html
or
http://www.hammersound.com/cgi-bin/soundlink.pl?action=view_download_page;ID=699;SoundFont_Location_Selected=Download%20USA;SoundFont_Filename_Selected=FluidR3122501.zip

I used SF2Comp to extract the WAV files:
http://www.hammersound.net/mirrors/last_night/sf.htm 

Then I matched WAVs to MIDI voices as well as I could.

I replaced the old samples at the request of a professional musician, who was finding the sample-to-sample timing a little off in the otherwise great samples I previously used from FranciscoPadilla's awesome human beatbox set:

(I've retained Franciscos's "Mute Triangle" sample, as I can't find one in Frank Wen's set).

Details of which samples went where follow:

(Firstly, I'm not a drummer).
I have aimed for anything with a "1" suffix to be 808-based; there is no 808 sample for "Crash Cymbal 1", however.
In got "Low Tumba" for "Low Conga", as that is what the original author had.
Everything else seemed pretty straightforward in terms of matching the names.
I have no mute triangle, however!  The Mute Triangle is still from the FranciscoPadilla set (http://www.freesound.org/usersViewSingle.php?id=132693).
